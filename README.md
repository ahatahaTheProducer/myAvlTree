# myAvlTree
In this project i implemented my own avl tree and made manipulations based on given txt files

It includes a project description file with a .pdf extension. According to information in that file my program manipulates whats come.
The sample output files are in given zip files. The expected outputs are in givenSampleOuts.zip and what my program gives in the mySampleOuts.zip file
corresponding to the given txt files such as large1.txt. There are minor differences between my files and the expected ones. If you see any mistake or something to
change in my avl tree implementation please inform me.

Any help is appriciated. Thanks :)
